        <h3>Origins</h3>
        <p>
          Chicken tikka masala is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of
          chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven,
          served in a creamy sauce.[1][2] A tomato and coriander sauce is
          common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey
          found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was
          chicken.[3][4] The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as
          purée), cream, coconut cream and a masala spice mix. The sauce and
          chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as
          turmeric, paprika, tomato purée or with food dye. Chicken tikka masala
          is similar to butter chicken, both in the method of creation and
          appearance.[5] Origins The origin of the dish is not certain, but many
          sources attribute it to the South Asian community in Great Britain;
          some sources also cite Glasgow as the city of origin.[2][6][7][8]
          Chicken tikka masala may derive from butter chicken, a popular dish in
          the northern Indian subcontinent. The Multicultural Handbook of Food,
          Nutrition and Dietetics credits its creation to Bangladeshi migrant
          chefs in Britain in the 1960s. They developed and served a number of
          new inauthentic "Indian" dishes, including chicken tikka masala.[9]
          Historians of ethnic food Peter and Colleen Grove discuss multiple
          claims regarding the origin of chicken tikka masala, concluding that
          the dish "was most certainly invented in Britain, probably by a
          Bangladeshi chef."[10] They suggest that "the shape of things to come
          may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh’s
          Indian Cookery published in 1961."[10] Another explanation claims that
          it originated in a restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland.[11][1] This
          version recounts how a British Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam,
          proprietor of a restaurant in Glasgow, invented chicken tikka masala
          by improvising a sauce made from a tin of condensed tomato soup, and
          spices.[12][13][7] Peter Grove challenged any claim that Aslam was the
          creator of the dish as it had already existed for several years
          before.[14] Chef Anita Jaisinghani, a correspondent in the Houston
          Chronicle, wrote that "the most likely story is that the modern
          version was created during the early ’70s by an enterprising Indian
          chef near London" who used Campbell's tomato soup.[15] However,
          restaurant owner Iqbal Wahhab claims that he and Peter Grove
          fabricated the story of a chef using tomato soup to create chicken
          tikka masala in order "to entertain journalists".[16][17][18] Rahul
          Verma, a food critic who writes for The Hindu,[19] claimed that the
          dish has its origins in the Punjab region.[20][11]
